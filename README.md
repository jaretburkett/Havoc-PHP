# Havoc PHP Framework #
### A lightweight, bare bones, framework for PHP. ###

Havoc is a very lightweight PHP framework that is very simple. It is designed for basic routing and login scripts only. You just need to copy the files to your root directory, modify the config.php file, run the database setup script, and you have a basic site with login and register capabilities ready to go.
